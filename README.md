Meteor Workshop @ JSConfUY 2015
================

What will we build?
-------------------
The idea is to build a Chat, which is a quite complicated task to achieve in any web technology, but very simple in Meteor because of the reactivity it offers out of the box.

How do I start?
---------------

First, if you haven't already, you need to install Meteor.

In Windows, download the latest version from [https://install.meteor.com/windows](https://install.meteor.com/windows), open the file and click next several times.

In OSX and Linux, you can simply run the following command into your Terminal in order to have Meteor installed.
~~~
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
