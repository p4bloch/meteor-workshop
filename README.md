Meteor Workshop @ JSConfUY 2015
================

What will we build?
-------------------
We will build a Chat, which is a quite complicated task to achieve in any web technology, but very simple in Meteor because of the full-stack reactivity it offers out of the box.

How do I start?
---------------

First, if you haven't already, you need to install Meteor.

In Windows, download the latest version from [https://install.meteor.com/windows](https://install.meteor.com/windows), open the .exe file and click next until it finishes :)

In OSX and Linux, you need to run the following command into your Terminal and you're all set.
~~~
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
~~~

Once you have Meteor installed, you need to clone this repo and cd into it
~~~
git clone https://github.com/p4bloch/meteor-workshop.git
cd meteor-workshop
~~~

now, in your terminal/cmd run `meteor` (shortcut for `meteor run`) to start Meteor. Then, open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), load the project in your favorite text editor, and start playing around. There are hints all over the files that hopefully will guide you through :)
 
 **Have fun!**
