Meteor Workshop @ JSConfUY 2015

What will we build?
-------------------
The idea is to build a Chat, which is a quite complicated task to achieve in any web technology, but very simple in Meteor because of the reactivity it offers out of the box.

How do I start?
---------------

First, if you haven't already, you need to install Meteor.
In Windows, download the latest version from https://install.meteor.com/windows
